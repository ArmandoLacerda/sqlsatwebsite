If you want to discuss an option or idea not listed below, please contact us, we will do our best to work with you!</p>

You will get the opportunity to join in the speaker's dinner to network one on one with speakers and influencers, host a lunch session (3 max), receive everything included in the Exhibitor sponsorship. Sign up to be a Platinum Exhibitor.</li>
    <li><b>Exhibitor ($1000)</b>. The ideal sponsor level for those that want to be on site to interact with our attendees. Exhibitors will be provided with a table and two chairs as needed in the foyer area. Sign up to be an Exhibitor!</li>
    <li><b>Brand Builder ($500)</b>. For sponsors who are not able to attend in person but want to support our event and build brand awareness.
