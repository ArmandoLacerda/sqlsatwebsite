    <p>SQL Saturday Minnesota 2023 #1054 is an entire day conference related to the SQL Server and data technology. SQL Saturday is organized by the PASS MN User Group, a 501c3 non-profit organization.</p>
    <p>With the help of a lot of Volunteers, we provide excellent sessions, refreshments, and lunch giving ample opportunities to interact with local professionals. We work hard to ensure that the SQLSaturday is an excellent experience for all, especially our Sponsors, without whom the event would not happen. </p>
    <p>This is our 1st in-person SQL Saturday event since 2019. SQL Saturday Minnesota used to proudly boast one of the largest and broadest events in the country and in 2023 we are looking to rebuild those heights. With the support of our Sponsors, it remains free and open to the public. We anticipate hitting the ground running and hope for a return of attendance for SQLSaturday comparable to previous years. The volunteer organizers of SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2023 are proud to offer the following Sponsorship opportunities.</p>
    <p>These are several ways to show your support of SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2023 and achieve maximum visibility for your company. Find details about these premium Marquee Sponsorship Opportunities below.</p>
