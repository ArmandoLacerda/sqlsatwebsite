    <p><b>Microsoft’s Vaccination Policy</b></p>
    <p>Guests and customers will be able to provide proof of vaccination or self-attest to having received a negative COVID-19 test within the previous week via <a href="msrtw.powerappsportals.com/en-US/">HealthCheck</a>). </p>
    <p>Guests who do not upload proof of vaccination must wear a face covering onsite.</p>
    <p>Guests and customers should follow local requirements for face coverings.</p>
    <p>If a guest or customer has uploaded their proof of vaccination, it will be valid for 30 days. After that period, they will need to re-upload if they plan to visit a Microsoft site again.</p>
