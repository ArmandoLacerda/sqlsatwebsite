    <h1>Additional Information</h1>
    <p>SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2022 is produced by and for the community of SQL developers, administrators, and affiliated disciplines. Event Sponsorship does not entail oversight or selection of topics or content.</p>
    <p>Credit card payments can be made online using PayPal to <a href="mailto:jaxssug@gmail.com">jaxssug@gmail.com</a>. or checks can be sent to 12375 Sunchase Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32246.</p>
    <p>Marquee, Gold, and Silver Sponsors will receive a csv file containing the name/email list of the 'opt-in' attendees in addition to the entrants for Sponsor’s raffle item.</p>
    <p>While SQLSaturday Jacksonville requires funds to operate, Sponsorship is also accepted in the form of ‘in-kind’ contributions where the goods or services provided are those required for SQLSaturday. We are especially interested in community groups helping plan and publicize the event. If you have any questions about how you can help, please contact us.</p>
    <p>About ‘in-kind’ Sponsorships: We make a distinction between Sponsors that provide ‘cash’, and those that provide ‘in-kind’ Products and Services for raffles or other use. Our reasoning is thus:</p>
    <p>A ‘cash’ Sponsor is providing the raw resource that is needed to produce SQLSaturday it pays equipment rental, shirts, lanyards, advertising, as well as refreshments and meals. Therefore, that Sponsor earns significant brand recognition and exposure benefits, as outlined in the Sponsorship ‘level’ document (Marquee, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.)</p>
    <p>An ‘in-kind’ Sponsor is providing an optional resource one that, if need be, we can do without. Also, quite often, that optional resource is serving to provide brand recognition and exposure. At past events, to maximize their brand exposure, some Sponsors have done both sponsored at a cash level that was practical for them AND provided branded items. Those Sponsors then received both sets of benefits as outlined above.</p>

    <h1>Logistics</h1>
    <p>We’ll open the doors to sponsors at 7:30 am. Sponsors will be provided with table and two chairs, and limited access to 110v power (please let us know what you need in advance). Tables will be in the same area as registration and breakfast to make it easy for attendees to stop by your table. We encourage sponsors to remain on site through at least lunch and if possible, to have a representative present at the end of the day to present your prize at the end of day raffle.</p>
    <p>Lunch will be provided to sponsors that have registered. Please have everyone from your team that will be attending register at www.sqlsaturday.com so that we can have enough food available.</p>
    
    <h1>Important Deadlines</h1>
    <p>Sponsorships must be received in full no later than April 2, 2022 to guarantee inclusion in print and display materials. All Sponsor supplied materials must be received by April 18, 2022. Contact us for applicable shipping addresses.</p>

    <h1>The Raffle – Your Key to Success!</h1>
    <p>The biggest challenge with community events is capturing contact information for follow ups. Few attendees will have business cards and having them hand write their info often leads to a 30% or higher loss due to inability to read what they wrote! We provide attendees with a set of pre-printed raffle tickets (see below) that will contain their name and email address; they are then able to put these tickets into the raffle box at each sponsor table to try to win a prize. This gives you 100% readability and 0% loss! It is also more effective than any other technique we’ve seen for trying to capture contact information and that includes scanning their name badge.</p>
    <p>Because we want you to be successful all our sponsorship levels include the requirement that you provide a prize of at least $100 in value, and that you provide a full color 8-1/2 x 11 flyers that highlights the prize(s) you are providing for the raffle.</p>
    <p>We provide the raffle box. We will have one table for all absentee vendors placed in the same areas with our onsite vendors. Raffle ticket collection will proceed through the end of the day. If someone from your team is present, we’ll ask them to draw the winning ticket, otherwise we’ll draw the ticket. Attendees must be present to win. If there is a physical prize we’ll give it to them, otherwise we’ll forward you their contact information for you to follow up with (for license keys, etc.)</p>
    <p>After the event we will mail you all the raffle tickets from your box. There may be duplicates; depending on how exciting your prize is attendees may contribute more than one ticket to your box – but that’s a good thing, they are willing to provide you their contact information in return for the chance to win.</p>
