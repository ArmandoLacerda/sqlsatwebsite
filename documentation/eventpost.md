The event post file is the blog post in Jekyll that describes the event and determines the date order in which is it shown. Each of these files is stored in the _posts folder with the following format: yyyy-mm-dd-SQLSat-nnnn.markdown. The values for each part of this name are:
- yyyy - The year in 4 digit format, i.e. 2023
- mm - The month in two digit format, i.e. 01 or 12
- dd - The day in two digit format, i.e. 02 or 22
- nnnn - a sequential number indicating the next numerical event. This value is assigned by SQL Saturday. If you do not know the next event, you can look in _posts and choose the next one for your PR or contact the webmaster.

The rest of the values should be included as it. A few examples of events:
- 2007-11-10-SQLSat-0001.markdown - The original Orlando SQL Saturday on Nov 10, 2007
- 2020-03-07-SQLSat-0929.markdown - The Baton Rouge BI Event just before the pandemic
- 2021-06-12-sqlsaturday1020.markdown - The first SQL Saturday under the non profit charity after the PASS organization declared bankruptcy
